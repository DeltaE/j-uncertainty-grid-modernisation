I NEED TO RUN rev_spec_kvar_kw_ratio.py

WITH INPUT: needed_parquets.pkl AND folder_timestamps.pkl

needed_parquets.pkl AND folder_timestamps.pkl ARE generated inside the folder "daily_csvs", inside folder *4_profiles_heat_pumps*

needed_parquets.pkl IS GENERATED BY: save_needed_sd_parquets.py
folder_timestamps.pkl IS GENERATED BY: parquet_to_csv.py

AFTER RUNNING rev_spec_kvar_kw_ratio.py YOU GET ALL THE kvar_ratios.pkl that you need to copy into daily_csvs AND PROCEED TO GENERATE THE CSVs.

Note: for the latest run with all NC circuits, it took 579 minutes. So it takes long! Thankfully, this is done just once.
